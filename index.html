        <p>Hi, I’m a physicist who recently graduated from MIT. I’m currently researching ways to make a better X-ray laser with
        Dr. Marin Soljacic and probing difficulty of simulating 2D quantum circuits with Dr. Aram Harrow.
        In the past, I’ve worked, at PsiQuantum, on improving single-photon sources for photonic quantum computing and designed and
        built a way to probe scattered light on a photonic chip.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I design and build websites (like this one) and bike around Boston as long as the weather is nice.</p>
        <p>If you want to reach me, please feel free to email me at <span class="email">esendonaris@gmail.com</span></p>
